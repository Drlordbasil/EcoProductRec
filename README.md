## Features
1. **Web Scraping**: Using libraries like BeautifulSoup, the script gathers product data from e-commerce websites, sustainability databases, and other online sources that provide information about eco-friendly products. It extracts relevant attributes such as material composition, energy efficiency, recyclability, carbon footprint, and certifications.

2. **Data Analysis and Classification**: The script applies machine learning algorithms, such as natural language processing (NLP) and classification models, to analyze the collected data. It identifies patterns and compares product attributes to classify items as eco-friendly or non-eco-friendly based on predefined criteria.

3. **User Input and Recommendations**: The script interacts with users to understand their preferences and requirements. Users can input specific product categories, features, or sustainability goals. The AI algorithm then recommends the most suitable eco-friendly products that align with the user's preferences.

4. **Rating and Reviews**: The script uses sentiment analysis techniques to analyze user reviews and ratings of the recommended products. It considers both positive and negative feedback to refine the recommendations over time and improve the accuracy of future suggestions.

5. **Integration with E-commerce Platforms**: The script can integrate with popular e-commerce platforms through APIs or web scraping techniques. It enables direct purchasing of recommended products or provides links to external websites where users can make informed buying decisions.

6. **Real-time Updates and Customization**: The script continuously updates its dataset by scraping online sources and incorporating new product releases, sustainability certifications, and emerging eco-friendly trends. Users can also customize their preferences and receive personalized recommendations based on their sustainability goals.

7. **Visualization and Reporting**: The script generates visualizations and reports to highlight the environmental impact of purchased eco-friendly products. It tracks metrics such as carbon savings, energy efficiency gains, waste reductions, and water conservation. This feature helps users understand and quantify the positive ecological contributions of their purchasing decisions.

8. **Community Collaborative Features**: The script can incorporate user feedback, contribute to community discussions, and collaborate with other users to share information, insights, and product recommendations. This fosters a sense of community and collective effort towards sustainable consumer choices.
